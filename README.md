## Banking System - Simple Account Hierarchy (C++ Project)

This is a simple banking system implemented in C++ using inheritance to represent different types of bank accounts.

### Project Overview

1. **Account** → The base class
2. **PersonalAccount** → Personal account (inherits from Account)
3. **BusinessAccount** → Business account (inherits from Account)

#### Project Objectives
- Demonstrate the concept of inheritance
- Use static members for tracking total accounts
